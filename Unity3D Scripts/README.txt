Place these scripts in your Unity Project.

Attach SimpleSave.js to an object in your scene.

In the inspector, type in the URL of your save.php file (e.g., 
http://yoururl.com/save.php) and your secret key.

Attach SimpleSaveExample.js to the same object and use it as a starting point 
for building your own save mechanisms.
